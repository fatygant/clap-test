## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

## Edge Cases

- What happens when no services match the applied filters? (Show empty state with suggested actions)
- How does system handle service with missing or broken images? (Display placeholder image)
- What happens when multiple users are filtering simultaneously? (Each user's filters are independent)
- How does system handle special characters in search queries? (Escape special characters, handle unicode)
- What happens if a service's price range changes while user is viewing catalog? (Display cached/current price)
- How does system handle very long service titles or descriptions in cards? (Truncate with ellipsis, full text on detail view)

## Assumptions

- Service data is available from a data source (API, local data, or mock data)
- Service listings include: title, category, description, price range, rating, review count, images
- Service categories follow the hierarchical structure defined in the specification
- Price information is available in Polish złoty (PLN)
- Ratings are displayed on a 5-star scale
- Images are available for all services (fallbacks to placeholder if not)
- Navigation uses Vue Router with client-side routing
- Responsive design uses Tailwind CSS breakpoints (mobile-first approach)
- No authentication required to view catalog (public access)
